### Lights out is a puzzle game where you must turn off all the lights to win! 
### Clicking on a light flips it, as well as the adjacent lights. 

You can play a browser version of the game on my portfolio here: 
If you want to run the game locally, you can find an executable in the StandaloneBuild folder. Have fun!
